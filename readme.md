## How to use
Run the `AddUIPanel.py` script in the text editor of the example `.blend` file -- then use the magnetic lines panel added to the object properties (object properties is the cube icon amongst the buttons screen-division, as shown in the screenshot above). To use with a new blender project, open all the `.py` files in the text editor, then run `AddUIPanel.py` to add the magnetic lines panel to the object properties.
